		I discovered this text through listening to
		<a href="https://pintswithaquinas.com">Pints with Aquinas</a>. Unfortunately, I could never get
		the pdf file there to download for me. So I had to look elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found the text of the document on
		<a
			href="https://catholicharboroffaithandmorals.com/St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas%20Lenten%20Meditations.html"
			>another website.</a

		I wanted to recreate it as a means of learning it better. I apologize for any typos. If you see
		anything that needs to be corrected,
		<a href="https://github.com/aaronkai/reflectionsForLent/issues"> let me know.</a>
	</p>
	<p>I hope this can be an aid to you during the season of Lent. ‚úù</p>
