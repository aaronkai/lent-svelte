		I discovered this text through listening to
		<a href="https://pintswithaquinas.com">Pints with Aquinas</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		I found the text on

		I wanted to recreate it as a means of learning it better. I apologize for any typos. If you see
		anything that needs to be corrected,
		<a href="https://github.com/aaronkai/reflectionsForLent/issues"> let me know.</a>

		I am a lay person and not a confirmed Catholic. Nonetheless, my intentions creating this site
		were good, and I hope you can enjoy it if you choose to.
